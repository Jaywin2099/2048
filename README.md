# 2048
the classic game of 2048, with twists (if i decide to impliment them)

to run just open the index.html file.
oooor run $node app.js and an express server will host the files on localhost:3000 

# log 
1/22/2022: 492 lines, game is almost complete, but there is no way to actually lose or restart.

1/25/2022: 368 lines, game movement made into one big, complex function. still no way to lose or restart.

1/30/2022: 427 lines. you can restart, but the game cannot quite sense when you are completely lost. every other non-aesthetic bit is complete 

1/30/2022: 421 lines, and the game is complete (aside from asthetical improvements that SHOULD be make lol)
